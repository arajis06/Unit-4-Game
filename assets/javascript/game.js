// THE GAME HAS 4 CRYSTALS AND A THE GAME RANDOM GENERATED NUMBER
// EACH CRYSTAL HAS TO PRODUCE A RANDOM NUMBER BETWEEN 1 - 12
// A NEW RANDOM GAME NUMBER SHOULD BE GENERATED EVERY TIME WE WIN OR LOSE THE GAME
// WHEN THE PLAYER CLICKS ON ANY OF THE 4 CRYSTALS, IT SHOULD ADD ITS HIDDEN NUMBER TO THE PREVIOUS NUMBER UNTIL IT EQUALS THE RANDOM NUMBER OF THE GAME 
// IF THE PLAYER HIDDEN CRYSTAL NUMBERS TOTAL IS GREATER THAN THE GAME GENERATED RANDOM NUMBER, WE DECREMENT A LOST COUNTER
// IF THE PLAYER HIDDEN CRYSTAL NUMBERS TOTAL IS EQUAL TO THE GAME GENERATED RANDOM NUMBER, WE INCREMENT A WIN COUNTER
